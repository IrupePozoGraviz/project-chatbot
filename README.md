# Project Name
The assignment was to make a functioning chat bot. A hard assignment for someone that is seeing code for almost the first time. Hig and lows but at the same time so much fun.

## The problem
The first way to try to tackle the solution was not the perfect and neither working for me, I kind of tried to do the project at the same time as I was watching the tutorials and not really figuring out what I was doing and why. When I got desperate one of the classmates told me to brake it down to smaller pieces and when I started doing that it started working.

To do the assignment I read alot of homepages watched alot of sites and their code tried to apply it to mine and se what worked and what not.
If I had more time I wold have more pictures more ways for the user to interact and also approach the problem in a different way, wich Im going to try for next week.
